Recognition of Facial Expression Using EigenVector and Euclidean Distance based Decision Making System 
======
Eigenvector based system to recognize facial expressions from digital images. 

The minimum euclidean distance between the trained image and all 

of the other images is computed and optimized. 

The similarity is computed by comparing the eigenvectors between images in question and images that 
require classification. 

An example image of babushka images are taken into account for analysis
